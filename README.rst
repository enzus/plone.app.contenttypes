Introduction
============

Dexterity-based default content types for Plone. This package is a drop-in replacement for Products.ATContenttypes.

plone.app.contenttypes provides default content-types (document, news item, file, etc.) that are extendable through-the-web. They aim to mimick the old default-types - the only change is that they are based on dexterity.
